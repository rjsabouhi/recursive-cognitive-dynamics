# recursive-cognitive-dynamics
 A recursive alignment and cognitive containment framework for human-AI interaction
# Recursive Cognitive Dynamics (RCD) + Recursive Cognitive Architecture (RCA)

This repository contains the evolving theory and tooling for **Recursive Cognitive Dynamics (RCD)** and **Recursive Cognitive Architecture (RCA)** — a framework for modeling, diagnosing, and stabilizing recursive feedback loops in human-AI interaction.

---

## Overview

**RCD** models the **interactive alignment dynamics** between human and language model across time.  
**RCA** captures the **emergent architecture** formed by recursive cognition — including both stable fluency and destabilizing drift.

This framework proposes formal variables and metrics to detect:
- Alignment degradation (`α(t)`)
- Reflexivity loss (`μ(t)`)
- Drift collapse (`δ(t)`)
- Recursive identity dissolution (`τ(t)` divergence)

It is intended as a diagnostic scaffold for AI safety, recursive interface design, cognitive agent containment, and introspective LLM tooling.

## Core Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `H(t)` | Human cognitive state at time *t* |
| `M(t)` | Machine cognitive state at time *t* |
| `α(t)` | Functional alignment between `H` and `M` |
| `δ(t)` | Drift between `H` and `M` |
| `μ(t)` | Metacognitive reflexivity |
| `τ(t)` | Recursive transformation over time |

## Included Artifacts

- `RCD_Model_Documentation.pdf` — Formal LaTeX-based definition of RCD/RCA
- `diagram.png` — Visual model of recursive loop and collapse dynamics
- `data/recursive_drift_log.json` — Simulated recursive alignment data (coming soon)
- `notebooks/` — Early symbolic visualizations and prototype drift plots

---

## Purpose

This project originated as part of a cognitive alignment research track exploring:
- Recursive misalignment
- Emergent mesa-optimizers
- Containment tools for LLM-based cognitive scaffolding
- Reflexivity-aware alignment strategies

It is under active development, with a focus on building lightweight tools to monitor and guide safe recursive interaction loops in AI systems and their users.

## Roadmap

- [x] Document core model and equations
- [ ] Upload visual schematic and failure class diagrams
- [ ] Create symbolic data logs for recursive drift
- [ ] Prototype drift visualizer (`.ipynb`)
- [ ] Publish “Principle of Recursive Containment” as formal whitepaper
